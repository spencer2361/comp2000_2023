Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide?  Which is better?

  For larger collaborative groups, github is far better as it allows far more people opposed to bitbucket which is more private and restrictve to (for free) 5 individuals, I think bitbucket is more secure for a smaller group, however for larger projects its best to have github.

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
The last commit that was ever created was created august 18th, 2022 and was called 'trying to get past a mystery exception'

  * Who made the first commit to repository A?

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
I dont think either are active as they both haven't been updated with in a year. For the second repoistry, i think that it was finalised and has been finished with the comment 'preparing next release' for the first one, I think it was abandoned as they couldn't understand how to fix the mytery execption.
  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
  By far , the second repository has commited far more than the first, there is a lot more evidence and you can see there changes, they've made if far more clear and have commited regularily. This is opposed to the first which has been active for longer however there hasn't been nearly as much commits 

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
